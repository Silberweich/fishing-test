# Fishing Test
 ### What is this
A controlled phishing test site. Modelled after [This](https://academic.ict.mahidol.ac.th/student/studentinfo/Default.aspx). Which is a university login site.  
Created in purpose of promoting MUICT CTF club and phishing awareness. Considering that so many buffoon in the faculty got phished for real last time a real attack happened. So this site aims to promote a small club introduction event, introduce Cybersecurity career and such.

***This site does not collect your password nor does it collect any personal information, it is almost a static site***

### The plan
- [x] use Go as a basic routing server, in a way to test my knowledge in Go.
```
$ go version
  go version go1.18.3 windows/amd64
```
- [x] Literally rip the page and css from [This](https://academic.ict.mahidol.ac.th/student/studentinfo/Default.aspx).
- [x] Make a "scare tactic" page, saying ***"OH NO PASSWORD STOLEN, WHAT DO NOW!!!".***
- [ ] Make a page promoting the upcoming event.
- [x] Setup the server on somekind of VPS (Money (TдT)).
- [ ] Get a domain name to make site more "phishable" (Money (TдT)).
- [ ] proceed with the plan.

### Will I get expelled due to misunderstanding with the faculty?
### ***Probably yes :), this repository is created to avoid confusion***
